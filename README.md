#Face Expression Detector Flutter App
This is a mobile app built using Flutter that uses Face recognition technology to detect whether a person is smiling or has a sad expression on their face. The app can take input from a live camera feed    .

#Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have Flutter installed on your machine. Once you have Flutter installed, clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred code editor.

Next, you will need to install the project dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
clone Repository
```
Next  Run 
```
flutter pub get
```
Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the app on an emulator or physical device using the following command:

Copy
```
flutter run
```
#Usage
The app will open a camera view that allows users to Deduct person's face. Once App  determine Face , the app will use facial recognition technology to determine whether the person in the Camera  video is smiling or has a sad expression.

The app will display the result on the screen with emoji of sad or smile  ;

#Limitations
Please note that the app is not perfect and may not always accurately detect facial expressions, especially in cases where the lighting conditions are poor or the person's face is partially obscured. Additionally, the app currently only detects two types of expressions (smiling or sad), and does not detect other emotions such as anger or surprise.
